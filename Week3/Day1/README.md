# Week 3, Day 1

## Today you will learn how to flip a sprite

## Run the script
 * Notice how the cat image does not flip when it changes direction

## Examine the code and make changes
 * pygame.transform.flip(IMAGE, XAXIS, YAXIS) is the  method that can flip an image
 * Uncomment (delete the '#') lines __ and __
 * Run the script again

## Make more changes
 * Notice that the image flips on both the x and y axis
 * We just want it to flip on the XAXIS
 * Figure out how to do this by making a change (look at line 9 above)
 * save changes

## Push changes to Github
 * cd ../..
 * git add .
 * git commit -m 'add msg here'
 * git push origin master
