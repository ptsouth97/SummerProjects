# Week 1, Day 3

## Examine file
  * 'vim Pygame2-Shapes.py'
  * See where colors are defined
  * All colors are combination of Red, Green, and Blue (RGB)
  * A tuple defines a color with 3 numbers representing R-G-B, with a max value of 255
  * So the color black is represented by (0, 0, 0)  -- no colors for each
  * Then the color white is (255, 255, 255) -- max color for each
  * Red is (255, 0, 0)
  * Green is (0, 255, 0)
  * Blue is (0, 0, 255)
  * Also notice how different shapes can be draw
