# Week 1, Day 5

## Today you will learn how to play sounds in Pygame

## Run the script
  * ./Pygame4-Text.py  

## Examine the code
  * 'vim Pygame4-Text.py'
  * Figure out how the sound is loaded and played

## Make changes
  * Find a new .wav sound file on the internet
  * Save the .wav file to the same directory where the script is located
  * Change the script so this new sound file is played instead
  * Write and quit with 'esc' + ':wq'
  * Run scripit to make sure it works

## Push changes to Github
